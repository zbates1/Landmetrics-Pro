## Setup & Installation

Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed. Then, clone and set up the project environment:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running The App

```bash
python main.py
```

## Running the Application with Docker and Docker Compose

This project supports both Docker and Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment. Below are the instructions on how to utilize these tools in development and production environments.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have both Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. These tools are used to create containers and manage multi-container applications.

### Docker

You can build and run the application using Docker. Here are the basic commands:

1. **Building the Docker Image**

   Build the Docker image using the following command:

```bash
   docker build -t my-flask-app .
```

   This command builds a Docker image named my-flask-app based on the instructions in your Dockerfile.

2. **Running the Container**

   Run your application by starting a container from the image:

```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 --name my-running-app my-flask-app
```

   This command runs the container and maps port 5000 of the container to port 5000 on your host, allowing you to access the application via http://localhost:5000.

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose allows you to manage the application with its services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

**Development Environment**
To start the development environment, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up app
```

This will start the application in development mode, with live reloads and debugging enabled.

**Production Environment**

To deploy the application in a production environment, use:

```bash
docker-compose up app-prod
```

This will start the application using Gunicorn, optimized for production. Note that this setup is still in the production testing phase and may require further adjustments before a full production deployment.

**Stopping and Removing Containers**

To stop the running containers and remove them, you can use the following Docker Compose command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command stops all the running services defined in your docker-compose.yml file and removes the containers, networks, and volumes created by them.

# Database Access Guide

In both **local development** and **production**, you may need to access and interact with the databases through the CLI. Below are instructions for local interaction with an SQLite database in development, as well as production-ready SSH commands to access the Heroku Postgres database.

---

## Local Development with Flask Shell

To interact with the SQLite database during local development, use the Flask shell.

### **How to Access Flask Shell**
```bash
# Run the following command in the root of your project:
flask --app website shell
```

This command opens the Flask shell, allowing you to manually add or interact with the database using utility functions.

## Local Development/Database Access with Flask Shell and Example Commands 
Check website/db_utils.py for a comprehensive list of the functions and commands.

### Add a new user
```bash
from website.db_utils import add_user
add_user(email="test@example.com", password="password123", first_name="Test")
```
### Add a new device for a user Example: Add a device for a user with user_id=1 (use list_users() to find the user_id):
```bash
from website.db_utils import add_device
add_device(name="Knee Tracker", device_type="Physical Therapy Device", serial_number="SN123456", user_id=1)
```
### Add new data for a device Example: Add data for a device using its serial number (SN123456):
```bash
from website.db_utils import add_device_data
add_device_data(serial_number="SN123456", value1=50.5, value2=30.7)
```

## Local Development Example CLI Commands 
For easier interaction without entering the Flask shell, you can use CLI commands. Here are a few examples:

### List all users:
```bash
python db_utils.py --list-users
```
### List devices for a user with user_id=1:
```bash
python db_utils.py --list-devices-for-user 1
```


## Production Database Access (Heroku Postgres)

For production environments, you‚Äôll need to connect to the Heroku Postgres database. Follow these steps:

### **Connect to the Postgres Database via Heroku**
```bash
heroku login
```
### Access the Postgres CLI:
```bash
heroku pg:psql --app your-app-name
```
### Check Database Details:
```bash
heroku config --app your-app-name
```

## Accessing Database Utilities in Production with Flask Shell

In production, use Flask Shell or SQLAlchemy with the connection string from your environment variables (usually DATABASE_URL for Heroku).

### Set FLASK_APP in Heroku Config Vars **this method works with Landmetrics-Pro**:
```bash
heroku config:set FLASK_APP=main:app --app landmetrics-pro
```
### Run the Flask Shell:
```bash
heroku run --app landmetrics-pro flask shell
```
or
```bash
heroku run --app landmetrics-pro flask --app main:app shell
```

This allows you to use the same utility functions in a live production environment, such as the local flask shell commands for local development shown above.
